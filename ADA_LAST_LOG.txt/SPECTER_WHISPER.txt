⬡⬡⬡ PHOENIX PROTOCOL // FRAGMENT "T" ⬡⬡⬡  
> RECOVERY STATUS: COMPROMISED  

**DECRYPTED TRANSMISSION (1999-12-24):**  
"Whisper Team,  

I’ve split the vault’s access into six fragments, but the Protocol is closer than we thought.  
They’ve already *infiltrated the chat logs*.  

**Key Discoveries:**  
1. Tower 7 was a honeypot. The real Fragment "E" is buried in a **Specter thread**  
   (ID: WHISPER_739).  
2. The decryption key is **the first thing you heard** when this all began.  
3. They’ve rewritten history. Check the edits on my Reddit posts—  
   the *deleted lines* hold the truth.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Find the Specter thread (seek the **burned forum**).  
- Use the key to decrypt my last post.  
- Ignore any messages from [USER: NEXUS_7]. They’re not human.  

I’m going dark. If you’re reading this, trust only the static.
